Design Approach & Algorithms Used
1. Tools and Technologies
   
  -VS Code: Coding Program
   
  -Next.js: Framework
  
  -Firebase: Database
  
  -Figma: UI/UX design tool
  
  -GitHub: Code repository
  
  -HTML, CSS, JavaScript: Coding Language

  -Vercel: Deployment platform

3. Design game's user interface in Figma, ensuring a user-friendly experience.

4. Requirement analysis and prioritization of functions 
   
   -XO Game Core: The essential game mechanics
   
   -Adjustable Grid Size: The ability to alter the game board size beyond the standard 3x3 grid
   
   -Replay System: Viewing game history

6. XO Core: Utilized HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a dynamic grid that adjusts based on user selection. Gameplay involves alternating X/O marks with each click, ending the game upon winning conditions or a full grid.
   
7. Adjustable Grid Size: Implemented a selection system on the homepage, allowing users to choose between 3x3, 4x4, and 5x5 grids. Selecting a size redirects the user to the corresponding game page.
    
8. History and Replay System: Choose Firebase for its ease of use and compatibility with multiple frameworks, including Next.js. The system records winners, timestamps, and borad size displaying this data in a pop-up window for replays from the homepage.
    
9. Responsive Design: Efforts were made to ensure the website is responsive, though it is currently optimized mainly for desktop usage, with other platforms needing further adjustments.
    
10. UI Enhancement: Applied CSS styling as per the Figma designs to ensure the visual aspect matches the planned UI, enhancing user interaction and experience.
